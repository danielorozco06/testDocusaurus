When you have code that runs asynchronously, Jest needs to know when the code it is testing has completed, before it can move on to another test. Jest has several ways to handle this.","sidebar":"docs"},"bypassing-module-mocks":{"id":"bypassing-module-mocks","title":"Bypassing module mocks","description":"Jest allows you to mock out whole modules in your tests, which can be useful for testing if your code is calling functions from that module correctly. However, sometimes you may want to use parts of a mocked module in your test file, in which case you want to access the original implementation, rather than a mocked version.","sidebar":"docs"},"cli":{"id":"cli","title":"Jest CLI Options","description":"The jest command line runner has a number of useful options.

You can create a mock function with jest.fn(). If no implementation is given, the mock function will return undefined when invoked.","sidebar":"api"},"mock-functions":{"id":"mock-functions","title":"Mock Functions","description":"Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.","sidebar":"docs"},"mongodb":{"id":"mongodb","title":"Using with MongoDB","description":"With the Global Setup/Teardown and Async Test Environment APIs, Jest can work smoothly with MongoDB.","sidebar":"docs"},"more-resources":{"id":"more-resources","title":"More Resources","description":"By now you should have a good idea of how Jest can help you test your applications.
